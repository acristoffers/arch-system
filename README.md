# Arch system

Simply a script to regenerate my Arch installation. It is meant to be run after
you install and boot your system (and probably setup network, as networking is
required).

First, edit and run `create_user.sh` if you have not created your user.

Then, log into your new user and run `setup.sh` to install and configure the
rest of the system.
